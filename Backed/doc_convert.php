<p>This Accident Reporting and Investigation Plan prescribe methods and practices for reporting<br />
and investigating accidents. No matter how conscientious the safety effort at a company,<br />
accidents happen occasionally due to human or system error. Therefore, this written plan is<br />
intended to provide a means to deal with all workplace accidents in a standardized way and<br />
demonstrate our company&#39;s compliance with the reporting requirements of29 CFR 1904. In<br />
addition, it is the policy of the company to comply with all workers&#39; compensation laws and<br />
regulations.</p>

<p><strong>Administrative Duties </strong></p>

<p>The safety coordinator is responsible for developing and maintaining this written<br />
Accident Reporting and Investigation Plan. This person is solely responsible for all facets of the<br />
plan and has full authority to make necessary decisions to ensure the success of this plan. The safety coordinator is also qualified, by appropriate training and experience that is commensurate with the complexity of the plan, to administer or oversee our Accident Reporting and Investigation Plan and conduct investigations.</p>

<p>This written Accident Reporting and Investigation Plan is kept at the following location:</p>

<p>HR and or Safety Office.</p>

<p><strong>Accident Reporting Procedures </strong></p>

<p>Our accident reporting procedures include the following:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Employees injured on the job are to report the injury to their supervisor (if possible) as<br />
	soon as possible after an incident/accident. &quot;Near miss&quot; accidents or incident should be<br />
	reported as well, i.e., when an employee nearly has an accident but is able to avoid an<br />
	injury or illness.</li>
</ol>

<p>2. The supervisor is to immediately notify the safety coordinator or appropriate manager<br />
designee, complete the company Accident Report Form (see the Appendices for a sample<br />
form) with the employee, any witnesses, and/or other relevant people. The supervisor<br />
will send the Accident Report Form to Safety coordinator no later than one<br />
business day after the accident and email or call Safety coordinator the day of<br />
the accident.</p>

<p>3. Any employee witnessing an accident at work is to call for emergency help or<br />
whatever assistance appears to be necessary. In addition, the employee is immediately to<br />
report the accident to a supervisor or manager and take part in answering questions<br />
related to the Accident Report Form and Accident Investigation Form</p>

<p>Accident Investigation Procedures</p>

<p>Thorough accident investigations will help the company determine why accidents occur, where<br />
they happen, and any trends that might be developing. Such identification is critical to preventing<br />
and controlling hazards and potential accidents. For all accident investigations, the supervisor, safety coordinator, a safety committee member or management designee will perform the following duties:</p>

<p>1. Conducts the accident investigation at the scene of the injury as soon after the injury as safely<br />
possible.</p>

<p>2. Asks the employee involved in the accident and any witnesses, in separate interviews, to tell<br />
him/her in their own words exactly what happened. He/ She does not interrupt or ask for more<br />
details at that time; he/she just lets the employee describe it in his/her own style.</p>

<p>3. Repeats the employee&#39;s version of the event back to the employee or witness and allows<br />
him/her to make any corrections or additions.</p>

<p>4. After the employee or witness has given his/her description of the event, asks appropriate<br />
questions that focus on causes.</p>

<p>5. Reminds the employee that the investigation is to determine the cause and possible corrective<br />
action that can eliminate the cause(s) of the accident.</p>

<p>6. Completes section &quot;Employee Data&quot; of the attached Accident Investigation Form with the<br />
employee, and review the data with the employee for accuracy. This will provide the information<br />
Safety coordinator or designee can put into database format. A copy of the Accident<br />
Investigation Form is to be sent to Safety coordinator or designee no more than one<br />
business day after the accident.</p>

<p>7. Uses the Accident Investigation Form for: Tracking and reporting injuries on a monthly basis;<br />
Grouping injuries by type, cause, body part affected, time of day, and process involved;<br />
Determining if any trends in injury occurrence exist and graphing those trends if possible;<br />
Identifying any equipment, materials, or environmental factors that seem to be commonly<br />
involved in injury incidents; Discussing with the safety committee and superiors the possible<br />
solutions to the problems identified; and Proceeding with improvements to reduce the likelihood<br />
of future injuries.</p>

<p>Injury, Illness, and Medical Issues</p>

<p>We also follow these procedures:</p>

<ol>
	<li>If a workplace accident results in an injury or illness requiring hospitalization of three or<br />
	more employees or a fatality of one or more employees, Safety Director reports the incident within eight hours by phone or in person to the nearest OSHA office.</li>
	<li>If an injured person is taken to a doctor, Safety coordinator will send the Accident Report form to Safety coordinator who will attach the doctor&#39;s statement to the Accident Report Form.</li>
	<li>If the injury or illness is &quot;recordable&quot; according to OSHA regulation, 29 CFR 1904, then<br />
	Safety coordinator or designee enters each recordable injury or illness on<br />
	OSHA Form 300, OSHA Form 301, and a separate, confidential list of privacy-concern<br />
	cases, if any, within seven calendar days of receiving information that a recordable injury<br />
	or illness has occurred.</li>
	<li>Employees with workplace injuries resulting in time off work shall be put in the<br />
	company&#39;s Return-to-Work Program to facilitate their full recovery and resumption of<br />
	original work.</li>
	<li>Compensation for workplace injuries or illnesses requiring time off work, will be compensated as indicated by federal, state and local law.</li>
	<li>Any time an associate is away from work because of an accident on-the-job, it should be<br />
	recorded in time and attendance under Workers Comp (WCP).</li>
